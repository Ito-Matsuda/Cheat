General Rules to Cheat / Bullshit / I Doubt it
	
	First Player plays any card(s)* they want (this will / should not be challenged / unecessary risk)
	Second player MUST play a card(s)* that is either one higher or one lower 
		It is at this point where the game begins
			Second player can "lie" about the card(s) they put down
			Any other player can call "bullshit" and if P2 was lying, P2 picks up all the cards on the stack
				If P2 was not lying, the player who called them out must pick up all the cards on the stack
	Game will continue until there are only 2 or 3 players left (it becomes too hard to "bullshit")

	Default will be 7 players

* The player can play any number of the same kind of cards 

Code Implementation

Objects
	Object 1 --> Player object
				 2 Attributes
				 1) An array of the "card" objects that represents the player's hand.
				 2) A sort of "memory" about which cards have been played should only be about 3 or 4 unique cards long

	Object 2 --> Card object
				 Has 2 attributes 
				 1) A number indicating the type
				 2) A string indicating the Suit
				 	Maybe change this to a number indicating suit
Methods
	Method 1 --> main, asks how many players (up to 10) that
	 there will be, will then call the generatePlayers function

	 Method 2 --> generatePlayers, based on number provided by main, will generate each players' decks
	 After succesfully doing so, will go to the next function that controls the flow of the game

	 Method 3 -->  controlFlow, will probably be a recursive call where the base case is 3 or 2 player left remaining
	 	Takes in (int numberLeft)

Testing
	Tests of each method as it is coded will be done
