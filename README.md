# Cheat
A text representation of a sample play-through of a card game known as "Cheat"

Like with Auto-Avalon, this will be very simple and is done out of curiosity and just for the fun of things.
Initially, will be done in Java and will hopefully use a shell script to output the results of the java file to a text file.

Maybe will decide to do this same thing in Python later on
